# Jesús Alveo  
Backend Developer | Java & Spring Boot  

## 👋 About Me

I'm a Software Development and Management student at the Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá, focused on backend engineering and building robust, scalable systems.

My main interest lies in backend development using Java and Spring Boot, applying clean architecture principles, secure coding practices, and containerized environments.

I aim to design systems that are maintainable, secure, and production-ready.
